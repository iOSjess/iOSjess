Hi, I'm Jessie! I'm an iOS developer who is passionate about making apps that solve simple and complex problems.
You'll find a wide array of languages and project types peppered throughout my profile, that's because I like to be multi-faceted and cross-functional.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on apps in the health, financial or security industries.
- ðŸŒ± I code in Swift, Combine and SwiftUI and am constantly expanding my knowledge of Swift architecture and unit testing.
